# Circles

    Here is the programming problem:

        Given two circles, defined by (c1, r1) and (c2, r2), where c1 and c2 are the centers
        of the circles; and r1 and r2 are the radii of the two circles.  Write a Python3 program
        that prints “True” if one circle is completely inside the other circle when given
        c1, r1 and c2, r2 as passed in as command line arguments.

        Inside the program you should create a Python function that passes in the same set of
        parameters and returns logical True if one circle is inside the other.  In the main()
        function, create test cases to verify that the function is correct.

        Use the best coding practice for Python that you know.  You may use any resources to
        obtain the answer, but you must be able to explain your answer in the code comments.
        Include links to references you used.  You have 24 hours to complete the task.

        Bonus:  Checkin your code to a public GitHub so I can download it and run it.  Apply
                best GitHub practice that you know.

### Running the program

    - from main.py run in terminal "python main.py arg1_x1 arg2_y1 arg3_r1 arg4_x2 arg5_y2 arg6_r2
    - For example: python main.py 1 2 3 1 2 1
    - I have also included a separate test_cases module using unittest
